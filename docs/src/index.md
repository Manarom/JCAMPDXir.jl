# JCAMPDXir.jl

## General description
This lightweight package enables reading and writing of infrared spectra files in the JCAMP-DX format, which typically uses the ".jdx" file extension. It was written for a specific task and cannot be considered as a complete implementation of all JCAMP-DX format specification. However, it implements the main functionality to read  and write JCAMP-DX files according to the `JCAMP-DX=4.24`.

The JCAMP-DX format for infrared spectra was created to facilitate the exchange of spectral data between laboratories. For a detailed overview of the JCAMP-DX infrared format, please refer to [JCAMP-DX for infrared 4.24](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/digital-standards/jcamp-dx/). In addition to spectra themselves, JCAMP-DX files also store some metadata containing information about the units of measurement and the conditions under which the spectra were acquired. A detailed specification of the format is provided via the link.
