# General description

This package is designed to read and write infrared spectra saved in JCAMP-DX (infrared) format.
The package was written for a specific task and cannot be considered as a complete implementation of all JCAMP-DX format specification; 
however, it implements some of the basic functionality to read  and write JCAMP-DX files
according to the `JCAMP-DX=4.24`.
Full package documentation is available at  [documentation](https://manarom.github.io/JCAMPDXir.jl/)

# About JCAMP-DX file format

JCAMP-DX file format was developed for the exchange of infrared spectra between different laboratories.
In addition to the spectra themselves, the file also stores metadata containing information about the measurement units and the conditions under which the spectra were acquired.
General descripton of JCAMP-DX infrared format can format is provided via the link
